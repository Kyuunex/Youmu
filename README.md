This bot was initially made back in 2018 when Aiess was a private bot 
and I needed a similar functionality for my server(s).
Recently, Naxess released a new version of [Aiess](https://github.com/Naxesss/Aiess/) 
which is public, a lot more user-friendly and a lot more flexible than my bot. 
Use it instead of my bot.
